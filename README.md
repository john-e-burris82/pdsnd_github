### Udacity's Python Bikeshare
Part of Programming for Data Science Nano Degree

### Description
This project focuses on pandas library usage and simple statistics methods to perform descriptive analysis on 2017 bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities - Chicago, Washington, and New York City.

It required interactive user input to filter the data by city, month, and weekday. It further requests if the user wishes to view raw data and if the user wants to explore additional analysis.

### Data used
chicago.csv - Stored in the data folder, the chicago.csv file is the dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Chicago provided by Udacity.

new_york_city.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of New York provided by Udacity.
